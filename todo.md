extraction model auto close after extraction is finished

add story modal not closing after adding a story so you can add multiple stories

maybe waring in series when two stories have the same name but arent in a series 

search bar in the main view to search by name and artist  

so now when i import serie form web and add cbz files and extract them and this chapter has 2 versions on the web it says i have no version downloaded wich is correct because i used a local cbz file but then when I hide the versions it deletes my local folder and i have to extract it again
