auto quick check button with auto download of 1 version 



scan icon when scanning folder 

the import modal after folder scanning not closing when clicking next to it because otherwise you have to run again

maybe scan folder in the main view only scans the folder and not the subfolders only checks for cbz or zip files


when extracting files from zip or cbz files it should show a progress bar or just a loading icon

after pressing add all in the import modal it should show a progress bar or just a loading icon on the button and all other add buttons should be disabled

extraction model auto close after extraction is finished

add story modal not closing after adding a story so you can add multiple stories

maybe waring in series when two stories have the same name but arent in a series 

search bar in the main view to search by name and artist  

so now when i import serie form web and add cbz files and extract them and this chapter has 2 versions on the web it says i have no version downloaded wich is correct because i used a local cbz file but then when I hide the versions it deletes my local folder and i have to extract it again
